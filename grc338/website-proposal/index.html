					<h1> About Us </h1>

					<p>    Papaver Tattoo Parlor gets it's name from the beautiful poppy flower. This flower holds a deep significance for our founder and store owner, Alena Robinson. Alena has lived in California, home to the beautiful orange poppy, her entire life. However, Alena is also extremley attatched to her Czech roots. Her grandmother, who Alena credits for most of her strength and perserverence, had the last name of Makovička; this translates to poppy in the Czech language.  </p>
          <p>    Given the significance of this flower, Alena dreamed about getting a poppy tattoo since she was a little kid. However, when the time came to get this tattoo, it took eons to find a parlor and artist that used the minimalist style that she wanted. From this frustration arose her idea to start a parlor that was dedicated to minimalist, botanical tattoo art — thus, Papaver Parlor was born!  </p>

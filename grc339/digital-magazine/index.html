                                  <p>
                                    Yosemite National Park is one of the most breathtaking places in the state of California. Nested in the Sierra Nevada Mountains, it is known best for its towering granite faces, humongous sequoia trees, and some of the cleanest water known to man. The valley has stolen the hearts of climbers, hikers, campers, and tourists. There’s something for everyone — dog/family friendly trails, more intense expert hikes, some of the most famous climbing spots in the world, and even museums, gift shops, and more!

In this article, I will discuss how I packed for a backpacking trip around Hetch-Hetchy — a valley in the northeastern part of Yosemite National Park, famous for its massive reservoir.

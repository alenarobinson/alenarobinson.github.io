                            <h3>Packing for Yosemite</h3>

                                <p>Yosemite National Park is one of the most breathtaking places in the state of California. Nested in the Sierra Nevada Mountains, it is known best for its towering granite faces, humongous sequoia trees, and some of the cleanest water known to man. The valley has stolen the hearts of climbers, hikers, campers, and tourists. There’s something for everyone — dog/family friendly trails, more intense expert hikes, some of the most famous climbing spots in the world, and even museums, gift shops, and more!
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                  Whether you want to backpack, camp, van-life it, or even stay in a hotel, Yosemite has so much to offer. In this article, I will discuss how I packed for a backpacking trip around Hetch-Hetchy — a valley in the northeastern part of Yosemite National Park, famous for its massive reservoir. From tents, to food, read on to find out some of my best kept secrets of this trip!
                                </p>

                                  So what was in my pack? Somehow, so much and so little all at the same time. This was my first major backpacking trip, and I am a NOTORIOUS overpacker, so I had very little context on how to pack and prepare. Luckily, my mother and I were accompanied on this trip by my brother (Sasha) and his girlfriend (Annie), who have backpacked all over California, Montana, and varioud parts of South America. So, I started by laying everything out on my bed that was going to go into my pack. I then had my brother check it over. He helped me pair down my belongings, and reach a sensible list of items.

                                <p>For a 5 day backpacking trip with car camping trips on either side (9 days total), I took one bathing suit, one pair of shorts, one pair of leggings, one pair of sweats, one long sleeve, one short sleeve, one tank top, 5 pairs of underwear, one sports bra, a couple pairs of socks (pro tip: backpack in 2 pairs of socks. Put the first pair on normally, and the second pair on top inside out! This will keep your boots from slipping and severly minimize the possibility of blisters.), a Patagonia fleece, a beanie, a hat, a buff, hiking boots, sandals (for hiking through streams) my sleeping bag (generic REI Backpacking Bag), sleeping mat, headlamp, journal and colored pencils/pens, and a good 'ol disposable camera.

                                  As far as sleeping went, we had a bit of a dual set up going on. My mother and I shared the most wonderful Big Agnes tent, perfect for the two of us. We had just enough room, and the rain fly kept an incredible amount of heat in at night. Sasha and Annie, on the other hand, rotated through a few different sleeping situations. A few of the nights, the two slept in their respective hammocks, usually tied up in the trees righ tnext to our tent. But there were a few exceptions to this arrangement. One night, the two slept cocooned together in a single hammock. Another night, we slept in a site with minimal tree coverage, so they set up a tarp on the ground and slept under the stars (all fine and dandy until they woke up covered in dew).

                                  Now, onto the most crucial part: FOOD! I have to say, I was slightly nervous for this aspect of the trip. I was fairly worried about packing light enough to fit everything in 2 Bear Cans (acquired at the Ranger Station), but still fuel my body enough for the trip. However, my fears went out the window as soon as we went grocery shopping. We bought a great deal of dehydrated items (lentils, oats, cocoa packets, etc.), and a few luxury items such as boxed mac & cheese! Breakfasts were usually oats and dried fruit. However, one morning (pictured above) we had the most wonderful pancake breakfast! Trail snacks/lunch consisted of bagged trail mix with nuts, dried fruit, and chocolate (we each had our respective bag that lasted the whole trip), and some high protein bars. Dinners were tortollini, lentil soup, and our celebratory last-night mac & cheese! We drank tea, hot cocoa, coffee, and OH SO MUCH water (Mom actually got pretty gnarly dehydration one day, but thats a story for another time). Overall, we fueled our bodies with some wonderful treats, and it was one of the most exhilirating experiences of my life.

                                Although we do not reccommend visiting J-Tree in the peak summer months (end of June - July) due to temperatures breaking 100 degrees, we do have some tips for surviving the hot, but less intense, summer heat. Hear about all our best tips and tricks for Joshua Tree in August.
